Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

Motivation:
In this era where fake news is rampant, we want to create an app - TweeterBuddy, that helps users check their tweets for fake news. Moreover, social media cancel culture is brutal and we want to help users avoid it by giving them an idea of their tweet’s sentiment, check for grammatical errors and offensive language. The last thing we want is for our users to lose a million followers overnight! Furthermore, we want the Internet and the social media space to be more inclusive, friendly and warm. This app will encourage users to use kinder language on the micro-blogging website Twitter and in turn make the Internet a safer space. 

Aim: 
We hope to create an application to enhance the utility of twitter by giving people an insight on how their tweet looks before posting it.

User Stories:
As a journalist, I want to tell the correct information to the public.
As a ‘netizen’, I want to create a culture of acceptance and positivity online.
As a Twitter user, I want to ensure I don’t consume fake news or propaganda.
As an influencer, I want to ensure my tweets are not offensive to my followers.

Features and Timeline:
An app for both iOS and Android that analyzes a tweet the user is about to make and gives feedback on it. It analyzes the tone of the tweet, whether it is spreading fake news and checks for offensive language and grammatical errors. 

Features to be completed by the mid of June:
Basic interface of the app - a textbox to write, look at past tweets. 
Sentiment analysis of the tweet.
Grammar and offensive language checker.

Features to be completed by the end of July:
Complete development of the interface of the app.
Fake news analysis of a tweet.

Possible extension features:
Post scheduler- schedules tweets and helps post it for the user
Post directly- user can tweet directly to twitter instead of having to copy-paste and switch apps
Save drafts- save drafts for people who are tinkering with possible tweets. 


Scope of Project:
The app provides a textbox interface for users to input their text and receive sentiment analysis and fake news analysis of their tweet. After which the user can post the text to twitter.

The app can also display the user’s tweet history, along with all historical analysis, for the user’s reference. 

We have created a telegram bot @TomatinatorBot (t.me/TomatinatorBot) for our evaluator teams to try out our model and evaluate our progress.

Features to be completed by the end of June:
Basic interface of the app - a textbox to write, look at past tweets. (To-be-completed)
Sentiment analysis of the tweet. (Completed)
Fake news analysis of the text entered. (To-be-completed)
